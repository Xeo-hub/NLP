            "David (Greek: Δαυίδ; fl. 630–641) was one of three co-emperors of Byzantium for a few months in late 641, and had the regnal name Tiberius. David was the son of Emperor Heraclius and his wife and niece Empress Martina. He was born after the emperor and empress had visited Jerusalem and his given name reflects a deliberate attempt to link the imperial family with the Biblical David. The David Plates, which depict the life of King David, may likewise have been created for the young prince or to commemorate his birth. David was given the senior court title caesar in 638, in a ceremony during which he received the kamelaukion cap previously worn by his older brother Heraclonas.\n",
            "After the death of Emperor Heraclius in February 641, when David was 10 years old, a power struggle ensued between different branches of the imperial family. As part of a compromise, David was raised to be co-emperor, ruling with his brother Heraclonas and their nephew Constans II. The Byzantine state faced serious challenges while Tiberius was co-emperor, with the ongoing Muslim conquest of Egypt and continuing religious strife over monothelitism and other Christological doctrines. All three emperors were children and the Empress Dowager Martina acted as regent. Martina was deeply unpopular due to her incestuous relationship with Heraclius, her unconventional habits, and her ambition. Her regime was deposed in a rebellion, probably by January 642. She and her sons were exiled to Rhodes and, in an early example of Byzantine political mutilation, Martina's tongue was cut out and the noses of her sons were cut off. There is no further historical record of Tiberius, and some historians speculate that he and his family lived out the rest of their lives peacefully.\n"

            "The Golden Age of Comic Books describes an era in the history of American comic books from 1938 to 1956. During this time, modern comic books were first published and rapidly increased in popularity. The superhero archetype was created and many well-known characters were introduced, including Superman, Batman, Robin, Captain Marvel, Captain America, and Wonder Woman. Between 1939 and 1941 Detective Comics and its sister company, All-American Publications, introduced popular superheroes such as Batman and Robin, Wonder Woman, the Flash, Green Lantern, Doctor Fate, the Atom, Hawkman, Green Arrow and Aquaman. Timely Comics, the 1940s predecessor of Marvel Comics, had million-selling titles featuring the Human Torch, the Sub-Mariner, and Captain America. Although DC and Timely characters are well remembered today, circulation figures suggest that the best-selling superhero title of the era was Fawcett Comics' Captain Marvel Adventures with sales of about 1.4 million copies per issue. The comic was published biweekly at one point to capitalize on its popularity. Another notable series was The Spirit by Will Eisner, which deviated from the usual publishing model of the period as a weekly multi-page supplement in the Register and Tribune Syndicate newspapers that Eisner held the copyright, a rare consideration for creators of that period. \n",
            "Patriotic heroes donning red, white, and blue were particularly popular during the time of the Second World War following the Shield's debut in 1940. Many heroes of this time period battled the Axis powers, with covers such as Captain America Comics #1 (cover-dated March 1941) showing the title character punching Nazi leader Adolf Hitler.As comic books grew in popularity, publishers began launching titles that expanded into a variety of genres. Dell Comics' non-superhero characters (particularly the licensed Walt Disney animated-character comics) outsold the superhero comics of the day. The publisher featured licensed movie and literary characters such as Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Roy Rogers and Tarzan. It was during this era that noted Donald Duck writer-artist Carl Barks rose to prominence. Additionally, MLJ's introduction of Archie Andrews in Pep Comics #22 (December 1941) gave rise to teen humor comics, with the Archie Andrews character remaining in print well into the 21st century.At the same time in Canada, American comic books were prohibited importation under the War Exchange Conservation Act which restricted the importation of non-essential goods. Canadian publishers responded to this lack of competition by producing titles of their own, informally called the Canadian Whites. While these titles flourished during the war, they did not survive the lifting of trade restrictions afterwards.\n",

            "=== Post-war and shift from superheroes ===\n",
            "A brief time period after the war until the mid-1950s is sometimes referred to as the Atomic Age of Comic Books. Some authors consider this an interregnum period or an era in its own right, but most regard it as still part of the Golden Age. During this time, the popularity of superhero comics waned. To retain reader interest, comic publishers diversified into other genres, such as war, Westerns, science fiction, romance, crime and horror. Many superhero titles were canceled or converted to other genres.In 1946, DC Comics' Superboy, Aquaman and Green Arrow were switched from More Fun Comics into Adventure Comics so More Fun could focus on humor. In 1948 All-American Comics, featuring Green Lantern, Johnny Thunder and Dr. Mid-Nite, was replaced with All-American Western. The following year, Flash Comics and Green Lantern were canceled. In 1951 All Star Comics, featuring the Justice Society of America, became All-Star Western. The next year Star Spangled Comics, featuring Robin, was retitled Star Spangled War Stories. Sensation Comics, featuring Wonder Woman, was canceled in 1953. The only superhero comics published continuously through the entire 1950s were Action Comics, Adventure Comics, Batman, Detective Comics, Superboy, Superman, Wonder Woman and World's Finest Comics.Plastic Man appeared in Quality Comics' Police Comics until 1950, when its focus switched to detective stories; his solo title continued bimonthly until issue 52, cover-dated February 1955. Timely Comics' The Human Torch was canceled with issue #35 (March 1949) and Marvel Mystery Comics, featuring the Human Torch, with issue #93 (Aug. 1949) became the horror comic Marvel Tales. Sub-Mariner Comics was canceled with issue #42 (June 1949) and Captain America Comics, by then Captain America's Weird Tales, with #75 (Feb. 1950). Harvey Comics' Black Cat was canceled in 1951 and rebooted as a horror comic later that year—the title would change to Black Cat Mystery, Black Cat Mystic, and eventually Black Cat Western for the final two issues, which included Black Cat stories. Lev Gleason Publications' Daredevil was edged out of his title by the Little Wise Guys in 1950. Fawcett Comics' Whiz Comics, Master Comics and Captain Marvel Adventures were canceled in 1953, and The Marvel Family was canceled the following year.Also during this period, the mass media with the advent of television were forcing media companies to put out comics that reflected the popular culture of the time period. Comic books focused on space, mystery, and suspense that television and other forms of media were turning to in the march toward scientific progress.\n",
            "According to historian Michael A. Amundson, appealing comic-book characters helped ease young readers' fear of nuclear war and neutralize anxiety about the questions posed by atomic power. It was during this period that long-running humor comics debuted, including EC Comics' series Mad and Dell's series Uncle Scrooge (both in 1952).\n",

            "In 1953, the comic book industry hit a setback when the United States Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency was created in order to investigate the problem of juvenile delinquency. After the publication of Fredric Wertham's Seduction of the Innocent the following year that claimed comics sparked illegal behavior among minors, comic book publishers such as EC's William Gaines were subpoenaed to testify in public hearings. As a result, the Comics Code Authority was created by the Association of Comics Magazine Publishers to enact self-censorship by comic book publishers. At this time, EC canceled its crime and horror titles and focused primarily on Mad. The Silver Age of Comic Books is recognized by some as beginning with the debut of the first successful new superhero since the Golden Age, DC Comics' new Flash, in Showcase #4 (Oct. 1956). However, others point to either the end of World War II in 1945, or in 1948 with the first outcry of Fredric Wertham as the end of the Golden Age. \n",

One language (Irish) previously had the lower status of \"treaty language\" before being upgraded to an official and working language in 2007, although it has been temporarily derogated as a working language until 2021 due to difficulty finding qualified translators.[6][7] The three procedural languages are those used in the day-to-day workings of the institutions of the EU. The designation of Irish as a \"treaty language\" meant that only primary legislation (the treaties) was to be translated into Irish, whereas secondary legislation (Directives and Regulations) did not have to be.\n",
            "The EU asserts that it is in favour of linguistic diversity. This principle is enshrined in the EU Charter (art. 22) and in the Treaty on European Union (art. 3(3) TEU).\n",
            "In the European Union, language policy is the responsibility of member states and EU does not have a common language policy; European Union institutions play a supporting role in this field, based on the principle of \"subsidiarity\", they promote a European dimension in the member states' language policies. The EU encourages all its citizens to be multilingual; specifically, it encourages them to be able to speak two languages in addition to their native language.[8] Though the EU has very limited influence in this area as the content of educational systems is the responsibility of individual member states, a number of EU funding programmes actively promote language learning and linguistic diversity.[9]\n",
            "The most widely spoken language in the EU is English, which is understood by 51% of all adults, while German is the most widely used mother tongue, spoken by 18%. All 24 official languages of the EU are accepted as working languages, but in practice only two – English and French – are in wide general use and of these English[10][11][12][13] is the more commonly used. French is an official language in all three of the cities that are political centres of the Union: Brussels (Belgium), Strasbourg (France) and Luxembourg City (Luxembourg).\n",

            "\n",
            "\n",
            "The number of member states exceeds the number of official languages, as several national languages are shared by two or more countries in the EU. Dutch, English, French, German, Greek, and Swedish are all official languages at the national level in multiple countries (see table above). In addition, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Hungarian, Irish, Italian, Slovak, and Slovene / Slovenian are official languages in multiple EU countries at the regional level.\n",
            "Furthermore, not all national languages have been accorded the status of official EU languages. These include Luxembourgish, an official language of Luxembourg since 1984, and Turkish, an official language of Cyprus.\n",
            "All languages of the EU are also working languages.[15] Documents which a member state or a person subject to the jurisdiction of a member state sends to institutions of the Community may be drafted in any one of the official languages selected by the sender. The reply is drafted in the same language. Regulations and other documents of general application are drafted in the twenty-four official languages. The Official Journal of the European Union is published in the twenty-four official languages.\n",
            "Legislation and documents of major public importance or interest are produced in all official languages, but that accounts for a minority of the institutions′ work. Other documents—e.g.,communications with the national authorities, decisions addressed to particular individuals or entities and correspondence—are translated only into the languages needed. For internal purposes the EU institutions are allowed by law to choose their own language arrangements. The European Commission, for example, conducts its internal business in three languages, English, French, and German (sometimes called \"procedural languages\"), and goes fully multilingual only for public information and communication purposes. The European Parliament, on the other hand, has members who need working documents in their own languages, so its document flow is fully multilingual from the outset.[18] Non-institutional EU bodies are not legally obliged to make language arrangement for all the 24 languages (Kik v. Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market, , 2003 ECJ I-8283).\n",
            "The linguistic translations are expensive.[19] According to the EU's English-language website,[20] the cost of maintaining the institutions’ policy of multilingualism—i.e.,the cost of translation and interpretation—was €1,123 million in 2005, which is 1% of the annual general budget of the EU, or €2.28 per person per year. The EU Parliament has made clear that its member states have autonomy for language education, which by treaty the European Community must respect.[21]\n",

Germanic languages are spoken in central and northern Europe and include Danish, Dutch, English, German, and Swedish. Romance languages are spoken in western, southern European regions; they include French, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian, and Spanish. The Slavic languages are to be found in the central Europe and the Balkans in southern Europe. They include Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Polish, Slovak, and Slovene. The Baltic languages, Latvian and Lithuanian; the Celtic languages, including Irish; and Greek are also Indo-European.\n",
            "Outside the Indo-European family, Estonian, Finnish, and Hungarian are Uralic languages while Maltese is the only Afroasiatic language with official status in the EU. The Basque language, a language isolate whose roots are unknown, is an official language in some parts of northern Spain, but not an official language of the EU.\n",

            "Most official EU languages are written in the Latin script. The two exceptions are Greek, which is written in the Greek script, and Bulgarian, which is written in Cyrillic script. With the accession of Bulgaria to the European Union on 1 January 2007, Cyrillic became the third official script of the European Union, following the Latin and Greek scripts.[22] The current design of euro banknotes has the word euro written in both the Latin and Greek (Ευρώ) alphabets; the Cyrillic spelling (Eвро) was added to the new Europa series of banknotes started in 2013 (see Linguistic issues concerning the euro).\n",

            "Although Maltese is an official language, the Council set a transitional period of three years from 1 May 2004, during which the institutions were not obliged to draft all acts in Maltese.[23] It was agreed that the Council could extend this transitional period by an additional year, but decided not to.[24] All new acts of the institutions were required to be adopted and published in Maltese from 30 April 2007.\n",
            "Irish\n",
            "When Ireland joined the EEC (now the EU) in 1973, Irish was accorded \"Treaty Language\" status. This meant that the founding EU Treaty was restated in Irish. Irish was also listed in that Treaty and all subsequent EU Treaties as one of the authentic languages of the Treaties.[25] As a Treaty Language, Irish was an official procedural language of the European Court of Justice.[26] It was also possible to correspond in written Irish with the EU Institutions.\n",
            "However, despite being the first official language of the Republic of Ireland and having been accorded minority-language status in the UK region of Northern Ireland, Irish was not made an official working language of the EU until 1 January 2007. On that date an EU Council Regulation making Irish an official working language of the EU came into effect.[27] This followed a unanimous decision on 13 June 2005 by EU foreign ministers that Irish would be made the 21st official language of the EU.[28] However, a derogation stipulates that not all documents have to be translated into Irish as is the case with the other official languages.[29][30]\n",
            "The regulation means that legislation approved by both the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers is translated into Irish, and interpretation from Irish is available at European Parliament plenary sessions and some Council meetings. The cost of translation, interpretation, publication, and legal services involved in making Irish an official EU language is estimated at just under €3.5 million a year.[31] On December 3, 2015, a new regulation passed by the Council has set a definitive schedule on the gradual reduction of the derogation of the Irish language. This new regulation outlines an actual schedule of gradual reduction spread across five years starting from 2016. If EU institutions have sufficient available translation capacity, and if no other Council regulations state otherwise, the derogation completely ends by January 2022.[32]\n",
            "Irish is the only official language of the Union that is not the most widely spoken language in any member state. According to the 2006 Irish census figures, there are 1.66million people in Ireland with some ability to speak Irish, out of a population of 4.6million, though only 538,500 use Irish on a daily basis (counting those who use it mainly in the education system) and just over 72,000 use Irish as a daily language outside the education system.[33]\n",

In negotiations with Croatia, however, it was accepted that Croatian would become a separate official EU language.[34]\n",

            "When the United Kingdom and Ireland joined the EU's predecessor in 1973, French was the dominant language of the institutions. With the addition of Sweden and Finland in the 1990s, and the Eastern European states in the 2000s, English slowly supplanted French as the dominant working language of the institutions. In 2015, it was estimated that 80% of legislative proposals were drafted first in English. The role of English as a lingua franca is believed to be likely to continue, given how heavily staff rely on it.[11][12]\n",
            "The interpretation of the legal rules covering the use of Official Languages has been open to speculation following the result of the Brexit referendum. Danuta Hübner, the head of the European Parliament's Constitutional Affairs Committee, has claimed that, after Brexit, English will no longer be an official EU language.[12] However, this statement has been contradicted by the European Commission Representation in Ireland, whose spokesperson described Ms Hübner's claim as \"incorrect\",[35] as well as by President Jean-Claude Juncker in an answer to a Parliamentary Question on 9 August 2017.[36]\n",

Some of them may have some official status within the member state and count many more speakers than some of the lesser-used official languages. The official languages of EU are in bold.\n",
            "In the list those idioms deemed by member states as mere dialects of an official language are not included. However many of these dialects are often viewed  as separate languages: Scots—the Germanic language descended from Old English, not the Celtic language known as Scottish Gaelic—and several Romance languages spoken in Portugal, France and Italy, such as Mirandese, Lombard, Ligurian, Piedmontese, Venetian, Corsican, Neapolitan, and Sicilian.\n",

The 667th Council Meeting of the Council of the European Union in Luxembourg on 13 June 2005, decided to authorise limited use at EU level of languages recognised by member states other than the official working languages. The Council granted recognition to \"languages other than the languages referred to in Council Regulation No 1/1958 whose status is recognised by the Constitution of a Member State on all or part of its territory or the use of which as a national language is authorised by law.\" The official use of such languages will be authorised on the basis of an administrative arrangement concluded between the Council and the requesting member state.[38]\n",

The Spanish government has assented to the provisions in respect of these languages.\n",

In turn, it will translate the Ombudsman's decisions from Spanish into the language of the complainant. Until such a body is established the agreement will not become effective; so far the body has not been created nor there is any budget allocated to this end. This leaving Catalan speakers without access to EU institutions in their mother tongue.\n",

Neither Luxembourg nor Cyprus have yet used the provision of the 13 June 2005 resolution to benefit from use in official EU institutions. On 26 February 2016 it was made public that Cyprus has asked to make Turkish an official EU language, in a “gesture” that could help reunification and improve EU–Turkey relations.[47] Already in 2004, it was planned that Turkish would become an official language when Cyprus reunites.[48]\n",

Russian is the native language of about 1.6 million Baltic Russians residing in Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania, as well as a sizeable community of about 3.5 million in Germany and as a major immigrant language elsewhere in the EU. Russian is also understood by a majority of ethnic Latvians, Estonians, and Lithuanians born before c. 1980, since, as official language of the Soviet Union, it was a compulsory school subject in those countries during the Soviet era. To a lesser extent, this legacy also holds true among the older generation in parts of the EU that were formerly part of the Eastern bloc, such as the GDR.\n",
            "On March 2010 fact-sheets in Russian produced by the EU executive's offices in Latvia were withdrawn, provoking criticism from Plaid Cymru MEP and European Free Alliance group President Jill Evans who called European Commission to continue to provide information in non-official EU languages and commented that \"it's disappointing to hear that the EU is bowing to pressure to exclude Russian speakers in the Baltic in this way\".[52]\n",

            "Latin\n",
            "For millennia, Latin has served as a lingua franca for administrative, scholarly, religious, political, etc. purposes in the area of the present-day European Union.  After the unique case of Athens and other Greek city-states of the 6th to 4th centuries B.C., the first documented political entity historically verifiable in Europe was the Roman Republic (traditionally founded in 509 B.C.) - the successor-state to the Etruscan city-state confederacies.[53]\n",
            "Latin as a lingua franca of Europe was rivalled only by Greek.  It still served as the official language in universities in the 20th century, and has operated as the official language of the Roman Catholic Church until today.  Latin, along with Greek, has been at the core of education in Europe from the schools of rhetoric of the Roman Republic in all of its provinces and territories, through the medieval trivium and quadrivium, through the humanists and the Renaissance, all the way to Newton's Principia Mathematica Philosophiae Naturalis (just to name one example of thousands of scientific works written in this language), to the public schools of all European countries, where Latin (along with Greek) is at the core of their curricula.  Latin served as the undisputed European lingua franca until the 19th century, when the cultures of unwritten languages and the \"national languages\" started to gain ground and claim status.  Today, several institutions of the European Union use Latin in their logos and domain names instead of listing their names in all the official languages. For example, the Court of Justice has its website at \"curia.europa.eu\".[54] The Court of Auditors uses Curia Rationum in its logo. The Council of the European Union has its website at  and its logo showing Consilium. The European Union itself has a Latin motto: \"In varietate concordia\". Under the European Company Regulation, companies can be incorporated as Societas Europaea (Latin for \"European Company\", often shortened to \"SE\" after the company's own proper name).  Latin is one of the languages of IATE (the inter-institutional terminology database of the European Union).\n",

In Hungary it is officially recognised by the Ministry of Education as a foreign language;[55] and examinations in Esperanto may be used to meet the requirements of knowledge of foreign languages needed to complete university or high school. Every year, since 2001, between 1000 and 3000 people have passed examinations in Esperanto, making up for a sum of more than 35,000 up to 2016; it is recognised by the Hungarian state.[56] The Hungarian census 2001 found 4575 Esperanto speakers in Hungary (4407 of them learned the language, for 168 of them it is a family or native language); In 2011 it found 8397 Esperanto speakers.[57] 25 years ago, in 1990 there were only 2083 Esperanto speakers in Hungary following the census.[58]\n",
            "Esperanto is not mentioned by the EU Commission as an EU language; the Commission mentions only official, indigenous regional and minority languages as well as languages of immigrants.[59] Following estimates there are approximately 100,000 Europeans sometimes using Esperanto (and several millions having learned Esperanto); the language has several thousand native speakers, some of them of the second or third generation.[60]\n",

They are based on the conclusions of the Grin Report,[61] which concluded that it would hypothetically allow savings to the EU of €25 billion a year (€54 for every citizen) and have other benefits. However, the EU Parliament has stated clearly that language education is the responsibility of member states.[21]\n",

Other widely used migrant languages include Berber languages which is spoken by about 1% of the population of both the Netherlands and Belgium and by many Berbers migrants in France, Spain, Italy and Germany. Arabic is spoken in many EU countries mainly in its two varieties Maghrebi Arabic and Levantine Arabic.  The Maghrebi Arabic is spoken by migrants in France, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany. The Levantine Arabic is spoken by migrants in Germany, France, United Kingdom, Sweden, Denmark, Austria and Greece. Hindi, Urdu, Bengali, Tamil, and Punjabi are spoken by immigrants from the Indian sub-continent in the United Kingdom.

French is most commonly studied and used in southern Europe, especially in Mediterranean countries, in Germany, Portugal, Romania, the UK, and Ireland. German, on the other hand, is commonly studied and used in the Benelux countries, in Scandinavia, and in the newer EU member states. Spanish is most commonly studied in France, Italy, Luxembourg, and Portugal. In 19 out of 29 countries polled, English is the most widely known language apart from the native language, this being particularly the case in Sweden (89%), Malta (88%); the Netherlands (87%); and Denmark (86%). 77% of EU citizens believe that children should learn English. English was considered the number one language to learn in all countries where the research was conducted except for the United Kingdom, Ireland and Luxembourg.

A notable exception is Romania, where 24% of the population speaks French as a foreign language compared to 6% who speak German as a foreign language. At the same time, the balance is being changed in the opposite direction by growth of the French-speaking population and decrease of the German-speaking population.\n",
            "Language skills are unevenly distributed both over the geographical area of Europe and over sociodemographic groups. Reasonably good language competences are perceived in relatively small member states with several state languages, lesser used native languages or \"language exchange\" with neighbouring countries. This is the case in Luxembourg, where 92% speak at least two languages. Those who live in southern European countries or countries where one of the major European languages is a state language have a lower likelihood of speaking multiple foreign languages. Only 5% of Turkish, 13% of Irish, 16% of Italians, 17% of Spanish and 18% from the UK speak at least two languages apart from their native language.\n",

The use of English vs. French depends a lot on the unit or directorate. Only a few of the Commissioners use a language other than English or French as their working language. German is rarely used as a true working language in the Commission, and German media have called the dominance of English and French a discrimination against German (which is by far the most spoken mother tongue of the EU) and a violation of the regulations pertaining to the EU's working languages.[74] The German Bundestag has repeatedly called for German to finally receive an equal position in the EU Commission alongside English and French.[75] The language situation also disappoints many in France,[76] and Kristalina Georgieva, who is from Bulgaria, gained a round of applause when she told Parliament she would learn French while in the Commission.[77] Parliament itself translates its proceedings into all official languages, although the actual spoken language of MEPs is sometimes English or French, so that fellow MEPs can understand them better than if they had the delayed translation.

Following a request from the European Parliament, the Commission in 2004 launched a feasibility study on the possible creation of a new EU agency, the \"European Agency for Language Learning and Linguistic Diversity.\" The study concludes that there are unmet needs in this field, and proposes two options: creating an agency or setting up a European network of \"Language Diversity Centres.\" The Commission believes that a network would be the most appropriate next step and, where possible, should build on existing structures; it will examine the possibility of financing it on a multi-annual basis through the proposed Lifelong Learning programme. Another interesting step would be to translate important public websites, such as the one of the European Central Bank, or Frontex web site also, in at least one other language than English or French.\n",

        "Though, you should note that even when we improved the performance of our Question Answering system, it still does not perform perfectly. You can test this by checking how it answers some of the questions in the test set. The main reason behind this is that we are truncating the contexts, which leads to losing the answer we are looking for on many occasions. Hugging Face does provide a better way of handling long contexts: let the long examples in our dataset give several input features, each of length shorter than the maximum length of the model. This can be achieved via the parameter ``return_overflowing_tokens=True`` and some additional configuration. If you want to know more about the topic, you can check [Hugging Face documentation about it](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter6/3b?fw=pt).\n",

        "You should also take into account that here we have used the F1 score as a metric to evaluate our model's performance. Yet, using this metric is just a simplification of how to deal with the evaluation, since it is based on the start and end values predicted by the model. If you want to dig deeper into other metrics that can be used for a Q&A, you can also check [this colab notebook](https://github.com/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/examples/question_answering.ipynb) resource from the Hugging Face team."

To compute the ROUGE scores, we need to generate summaries. 🤗 Transformers makes this automatically for us through two dedicated classes ``Seq2SeqTrainingArguments`` and ``Seq2SeqTrainer``. Hence, instead of instantiating objects from the classes ``TrainingArguments`` and ``Trainer``, we will use the Seq2Seq-specific ones.\n",

        "      * ``predict_with_generate=True`` to generate summaries during evaluation so that we can compute ROUGE scores for each epoch. The Transformer's decoder performs inference by predicting tokens one by one, and this is implemented by the model’s ``generate()`` method. Setting ``predict_with_generate=True`` tells the Seq2SeqTrainer to use that method for evaluation.\n",
        "      *   ``save_total_limit`` to limit the number of checkpoints saved during training. This is necessary since even the \"small\" version of T5 uses around a GB of hard drive space, and we can save a bit of room by limiting the number of copies we save.\n",
        "  * The usage of the ``Seq2SeqTrainer`` class is equivalent to that of the ``Trainer`` class.\n",
        "2. Since T5 is an **encoder-decoder Transformer model**, during decoding, we need to shift the labels to the right by one when preparing our batches. This is necessary to ensure that the decoder only sees the previous ground truth labels and not the current or future ones, which would be easy for the model to memorize. 🤗 Transformers provides a ``DataCollatorForSeq2Seq`` collator that will dynamically pad the inputs and the labels for us. The way we instantiate this collator is by providing the tokenizer and model. From this dynamic padding, there are two main things that we need to take into account:\n",
        "  * ``input_ids`` and ``attention_mask`` of shorter sentences get padded on the right with a [PAD] token (whose ID is 0)\n",
